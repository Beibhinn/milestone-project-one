                            <p>Pink Floyd is a British rock band formed in 1965, recognised for their progressive and psychedelic music. The band was founded by students Syd Barrett (guitar and lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass and vocals),
                                and Richard Wright (keyboards and vocals). They became popular while performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s. Under Barrett's leadership the band released two charting singles and a successful
                                debut album, 'The Piper at the Gates of Dawn' (1967). </p>
                            <p>Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined the band in December 1967; however Barrett left shortly after, in April 1968, due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and conceptual leader,
                                devising the concepts behind their albums 'The Dark Side of the Moon' (1973), 'Wish You Were Here' (1975), 'Animals' (1977), 'The Wall' (1979) and 'The Final Cut' (1983). 'The Dark Side of the Moon' and 'The Wall' went
                                on to become two of the best-selling albums of all time. </p>
                            <p>Following creative differences, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright did, however, later rejoin the band. The three produced two more albums— 'A Momentary
                                Lapse of Reason' (1987) and 'The Division Bell' (1994)—and toured through 1994. After nearly two decades, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason reunited with Waters in 2005 to perform as Pink Floyd in London as part of the global
                                awareness event Live 8.</p>

                        <p> Pink Floyd's combination of music and visuals set the standard for following rock musicians. The band is renowned for their stage shows, combining intense visual experiences with music, in order to create a show in which the performers
                            themselves are almost secondary. </p>

                        <p>Pink Floyd were among the first bands to use a dedicated travelling light show as part of their performances. During the Barrett era, dynamic liquid light shows were projected onto enormous screens behind the band while they played,
                            and a large numbers of strobe lights were also incorporated, which were controlled manually by an engineer. This had the effect of totally obscuring the band itself, except for their shadows, which Barrett took advantage of.
                            Barrett would hold his arms up during parts where he was not required to play, making his shadow grow, shrink and undulate, adding to the visual spectacle. </p>
                        <p>A large circular projection panel dubbed "Mr Screen" first made an appearance during performances of 'Dark Side of the Moon' in 1974 and became a staple thereafter. Specially recorded films and animations were projected onto it,
                            and for 1977 'In the Flesh' and 1980–1981 'The Wall Live' tours, coloured spotlights were fixed around the rim. </p>
                        <p>Pink Floyd's tours became a staple in the industry because of their outstanding special and scenic effects. Pyrotechnics (such as exploding flashpots, an exploding gong and fireworks) and dry ice were used extensively throughout
                            Pink Floyd's career. In 1973's tour to promote 'The Dark Side of the Moon', a large scale model plane flew over the audience and crashed onto the stage with a spectacular explosion, an effect repeated at the start of 'The Wall'
                            and the 'Division Bell' shows. During shows to promote 'A Momentary Lapse of Reason', a similar effect was achieved with a flying bed. </p>

                        <p>The special effects used by Pink Floyd reached a new and outrageous level during the 1980–1981 'The Wall' shows. A 160-foot (49 m) long, 35-foot (11 m) high wall made from 340 white bricks was built between the audience and the
                            band during the first half of the show. The final brick was placed as Roger Waters sang "goodbye" at the end of the song 'Goodbye Cruel World'. <br> For the second half of the show, the band was largely invisible, except for
                            a hole in the wall that simulated a hotel room where Roger Waters "acted out" the story of Pink, and an appearance by David Gilmour on top of the wall to perform the climactic guitar solo in 'Comfortably Numb'. Other parts
                            of the story were told by Gerald Scarfe animations projected onto the wall itself (these animations were later integrated into the film Pink Floyd: The Wall). At the finale of the concert, the wall was demolished amidst sound
                            effects and a spectacular light show.</p>

                        <p>Having performed at some of the largest venues, festivals and charity events in the world, over a career spanning decades, it is clear that Pink Floyd know how to put on a show. The specifc effects in use between concerts may vary,
                            however, you can expect a Pink Floyd performance to be spectacular.</p> <br>
